# MonsterLookup
___
A side project to familiarise myself with Compose.

## About

Desktop app that lets you search for monsters from Dungeons and Dragons and easily view them and their actions, abilities and stats. 

The app UI is built with [Compose Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose-mpp/) and supports both dark and light themes.

The monster information is fetched from an open Dungeons and Dragons [API](https://www.dnd5eapi.co/) 
that lets you fetch information from monsters, items, spells, etc in JSON format.

## Planned

- Add a loading animation when searching
- Add proper fonts
- Make better use of themes by moving shapes and typography into it
- UI Tests
